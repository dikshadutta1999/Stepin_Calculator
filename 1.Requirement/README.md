# Requirements 

## Introduction 
The project will be a simple Scientific Calculator implementation in C. You will use various
calculations to calculate different mathematical operations.
The study traced calculator system as a tool to completely change mathematical knowledge and sophisticated problems 
solving strategies had advanced the field of simulated engine in mathematic.In this we also reverse string and calculate the EMI.

## Objective 
The main objectives of this project are: 
1. To be familiar with C programming language.
2. To implement various mathematical operations in C language.
3. To build a simple project on C.

## SWOT ANALYSIS
![SWOT](https://github.com/dikshadutta1999/Stepin_Calculator/blob/main/1.Requirement/swot.jpg)

## ***4 W's and 1 H***
## Who
Anyone who have faces difficulty in solving the mathematical expression. 
## What
This project is concerned about solving the mathematical expression by using multifile.
## When 
Whenever there is an unsolved mathematical calculation this project helps in solving it.
## Why
As this project uses beginner's algorithm it can be easy to solve the mathematical expression.
## How
Implemented using structure, pointers, enum and other functionalities of C.

##Basic requirements that are very essential are:
* A rubik's cube application or a real rubik's cube.
* gcc compiler with a good system.
* Any of the two linux/windows.
* Pentium IV Processor 
* RAM: 512 MB Hard disk: 2 GB
